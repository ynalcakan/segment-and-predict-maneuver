# segment-and-predict-maneuver
- [ ] setup detectron2 (with pre-trained weights)
- [ ] give bdd-100k Cut-in / Lane-pass dataset and get segmented RGB images
- [ ] give segmented RGB to AlexNet + LSTM and get results. (use same LSTM with previous approach and try Bi-LSTM also.)


2nd approach:
- [ ] cut-off the last FC layer of Detectron2 
- [ ] Find a way to connect Detectron2 to LSTM
